# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Java. It serves as a resource for learning and understanding different data structures and their operations.

## Overview

Data structures are fundamental components of computer science and software development. They provide efficient ways to store, organize, and manipulate data, enabling efficient algorithms and problem-solving techniques. This repository aims to provide implementations of commonly used data structures in Java, along with detailed explanations and examples of their usage.

## Implemented Data Structures

The following data structures have been implemented in this repository:

- **Array**: A fixed-size collection of elements, accessed by their indices.
- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node, containing both the data and a reference to the next node.
- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that supports insertion and deletion at one end, called the top.
- **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that supports insertion at the rear and deletion from the front.
- **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree-based data structure that maintains a specific order among its elements, allowing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Heap**: A complete binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, making it useful for efficient priority queue operations.
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that implements an associative array, mapping keys to values using a hash function for efficient retrieval and insertion.
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, representing relationships between different entities.
- **Trie**: A tree-like data structure that stores a collection of strings, enabling efficient prefix-based search operations.

Each data structure is implemented with appropriate methods and operations, enabling you to perform common operations like insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.

## Getting Started

To get started with using these data structures:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/HarshitTamrakar/DataStructures.git```
   
2. Navigate to the src directory to access the Java source files for each data structure.

3. Open the desired data structure implementation in your preferred Java development environment.

4. Explore the code and accompanying comments to understand the data structure's implementation details and available operations.

5. Use the provided examples and test cases to learn how to use the data structures effectively.
